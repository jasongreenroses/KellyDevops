Increase the Git buffer size to the largest individual file size of your repo:
$git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400

Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '192.30.252.128' to the list of known hosts.
Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa':
Hi telmeobet!  You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

=========================================================================
Generate SSH key :
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
1.ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
2.ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
# Generating public/private rsa key pair.
3.Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
4.Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase] (Give the passwards if u want else enter)
# Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
After you enter a passphrase, you'll be given the fingerprint, or id, of your SSH key. 
It will look something like this:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:
# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com
go to the .ssh folder(/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) and open that file and copy the content of id_rsa.pub (where u have generated your private key)
Go to Git >settings>ssh key > add there..
===========================================================================
If u are getting these error:
Fatal error or connection refuse or connection timeout on port 22
ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection timed out
while
>git push
u ll get this error:
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
if u ll get 403:Forrbiden UrL : change ur remote URL as SSH :
Set remote url as ssh: like this:
$git remote set-url origin git@github.com:telmerobert/BannaRepoTest.git
$ git remote -v
#Verify new remote URL
# origin  git@github.com::telmerobert/Provisioning.git (fetch)
# origin  git@github.com:telmerobert/Povisioning.git (push)

SSH is probably blocked on port 22
1.Add ports to the ACL 
2.add ip of github  192.30.252.128 to acl egress and ingress.
3.turn off iptable:
 chkconfig iptables off
 service iptables status
 service iptables stop
 service iptables status
